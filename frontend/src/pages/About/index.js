        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          FoodShare is a community-driven platform dedicated to reducing food
          waste and fighting hunger. We connect generous food donors with
          individuals and families in need, creating a sustainable cycle of
          sharing and caring.
        </p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>For Donors:</strong> If you have excess food, simply create a
          listing with details about the food item, quantity, and pickup
          location. Recipients in your area can express interest, and you can
          arrange the handover.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>For Recipients:</strong> Browse available food donations in
          your area, express interest in items you need, and coordinate pickup
          with the donor.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Impact</h2>
        <p>
          Together, we're making a difference by preventing thousands of pounds
          of food from going to waste while ensuring no one in our community
          goes hungry.
        </p>

        <h2>Join Us</h2>
        <p>
          Whether you have food to share or need assistance, you're welcome
          here. Together, we can build a stronger, more caring community.
